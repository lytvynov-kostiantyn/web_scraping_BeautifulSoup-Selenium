# Web Scraping using Beautiful Soup and Selenium for dynamic page

### Description:
A training project whose goal is to collect open data (contact information: phone numbers, mail, and social networks)
with their subsequent recording in a JSON file.

Python's Beautiful Soup library is a powerful tool for web scraping. It simplifies traversing the DOM and is excellent
for static scraping, where the data is readily available in "view page source". However, for dynamic scraping, where
the data is present in components rendered by clicking JavaScript links, Beautiful Soup alone won't suffice. In such
cases, Selenium can automate the browser interaction to click on the links, making the data available to Beautiful
Soup for extraction.

### Under the hood:
`main.py` - it is a main file of the project

`requirements.txt` - it is a file listing all the dependencies for Python project.
